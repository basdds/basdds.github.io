First blogpost; testing out the Jekyll blogging platform for usability. 

Having a static blogging CMS without having to use wordpress is **great**! I really like this!

## Jekyll PRO's: 

* Jekyll creates a static HTML website. No server side scripting needed!
* Also NO database required! All your posts are just 'flat' textfiles.
* Secure! No endless CMS security-updates required! 
* Can be used with free webhosting via github pages (see link in footer)
* Edit your posts in **markdown**.
* Making a new post is as simple as: create new texfile in terminal > git push > done. 
* No wordpress bloatware! (Oh, did I mention this before???? ;-) 

## Jekyll CON's: 

* Slight learing curve.... 
* No 'administrator 'GUI', all editing is done via texfiles / the command line (no problem for me, but might put some people off..)  
* Deployment of posts to github-pages takes a while for your changes to be 'live'.
