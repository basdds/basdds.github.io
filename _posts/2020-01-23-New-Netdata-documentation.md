The people behind 'Netdata' released some nice new documentation on getting started with Netdata.

I use Netdata for monitoring the performance of my (private) VPS server(s):

Netdata is really lightweight (though it's collecting 2,000 metrics every second!!) and can give you a instant view on how your vps / server is performing. I totally recommend it!

The new guide also explains things like building custom dashboards and storing long-term metrics.
