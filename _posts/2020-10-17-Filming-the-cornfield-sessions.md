['The cornfield sessions!'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb7l-J_gLXsRTuWGM5F99laOdJZaoZIWs){:target="_blank"}

In 2013 the band Bootsman (John Elburg & Hans Matena at the time) did a [live performance](https://www.gelderlander.nl/achterhoek/bootsman-en-the-cornfield-sessions~a17f0f5d/){:target="_blank"} 
for an 'audience' of few thousands of corn plants; They called it 'The Cornfield sessions'. I was the band's photographer and really had a lot of fun documenting this!

Fast-forward 7 years later: 

Now it's 2020 and all the band's gigs where cancelled last summer.. Because of all the covid-19 restrictions in the Netherlands.

So they decided to do a re-make of the Cornfield sessions. And I got the 'job' of filming it all:

My (band) photography hobby has shifted to doing video the last couple of years. Normally I just went to a gig with my DSLR and recorded it in one take. But this production was ...different... :-)

Some things I've learned during this production where:

* Syncing external (exellent!) audio recording to video (clap!) :-) 
* Using multiple camera sources and syncing footage in 'post'   
* Ditching 'OpenShot' as video editing software and learning [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/){:target="_blank"} 



Anno 2020 Bootsman is: 

* Addi Hoopman (bass)
* John Elburg (vocals, guitar)
* Luc Poels (guitar, backing vocals)
* Sascha Hartmann (percussion)
