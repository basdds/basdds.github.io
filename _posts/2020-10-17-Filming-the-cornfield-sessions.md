['The cornfield sessions!'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb7l-J_gLXsRTuWGM5F99laOdJZaoZIWs){:target="_blank"}

In 2013 the band Bootsman (John Elburg & Hans Matena at the time) did a [live performance](https://www.gelderlander.nl/achterhoek/bootsman-en-the-cornfield-sessions~a17f0f5d/){:target="_blank"} 
for an 'audience' of few thousands of corn plants; They called it 'The Cornfield sessions'. I was the band's photographer and really had a lot of fun documenting this gig!

Fast-forward 7 years later: 

Now it's 2020 and all the band's gigs where cancelled last summer... Because of all the covid-19 restrictions in the Netherlands.

So they decided to do a re-make of the Cornfield sessions. And I got the 'job' of filming it all...

My photography hobby has shifted to doing video productions the last couple of years. 




The band members have changed over the years. Anno 2020 Bootsman is: 

Addi Hoopman (bass)

John Elburg (vocals, guitar)

Luc Poels (guitar, backing vocals)

Sascha Hartmann (percussion)
