['The cornfield sessions!'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb7l-J_gLXsRTuWGM5F99laOdJZaoZIWs){:target="_blank"}

In 2013 the band Bootsman -John Elburg & Hans Matena at the time (*)- did a [live performance](https://www.gelderlander.nl/achterhoek/bootsman-en-the-cornfield-sessions~a17f0f5d/){:target="_blank"} 
for an 'audience' of few thousands of corn plants; They called it 'The Cornfield sessions'. I was the band's photographer and really had a lot of fun documenting this!

Fast-forward 7 years later: 

Now it's 2020 and all the band's gigs where cancelled last summer.. Because of all the covid-19 restrictions in the Netherlands.

So they decided to do a re-make of the Cornfield sessions. And I got the voluntary 'job' of filming it all. :-)

My (band) photography hobby has slowly shifted to doing video, the last couple of years. Normally I just go to a gig with my DSLR and record it in one single take. But this was... different!

A few things I've learned during this production where:

* Syncing external audio recordings to my video. (do the clap!) 
* Using multiple camera sources and syncing this footage in 'post'.  
* Ditching 'OpenShot' as video editing software and learning [Davinci Resolve!](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/){:target="_blank"} 
* I should get some variable ND filters! (filming in really harsh sunlight is tough!)
* My old 550D gets overheated very quickly. (cool down your camera's, inbetween takes) 
* Save your camera batteries, or get some spares. 
* Let the band do a one-time 'rehearsal' of each song, before starting the recording.   
* Having a great audio engineer (on-site and during post!) is quite a luxury. (thanx for the great sound Addi!) 
* Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey tastes great after a long shoot! :-)   


(*) Anno 2020 Bootsman is: 

* Addi Hoopman (bass)
* John Elburg (vocals, guitar)
* Luc Poels (guitar, backing vocals)
* Sascha Hartmann (percussion)
