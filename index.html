<h1>'Hello World!'</h1> 

<p>This is a reboot of my previous 'bas.dds.nl' blog, maintained from 2012 to 2016.

<p>I'll try to get some of my older posts online someday! But for now I'll make fresh 
start with a <a href="blog.html">New Blog!</a>

<h2>Short 'Q&A' on this blog</h2>

<p><b>Q: What to find here?</b> - I'm not a regular blogger, writing lengthy pieces. Mostly I just see/find some cool things online and 
want to scribble down some links and notes on it. Doing this in a personal blog post was always a nice way to save these notes 
'someplace online'. <br><br>

In the past I had a lot of 'HOWTO' posts. (how to do certain things in tech, mostly linux related). I found out 'how-to something' and 
wrote a short tutorial on it, for reference. Might do those kind of posts in the near future again!

<p><b>Q: What's your post-frequency?</b> - Ahem.... don't bother to ask me for a RSS feed! :-)

<p><b>Q: Why the minimal-design?</b> - I always liked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">the KISS principle</a> a lot! 
And I think this works for websites too; Just 'keep it simple stupid'! Why bother with all kinds of 'eye-candy' and images, if your content 
is mostly plain-text anyway? 

<p><b>Q: What software do you use for blogging?</b> - See the footer below, or my first post <A href="https://bas.rel.nl/2020/01/20/firstpost.html">
on using jekyll and github for blogging.</a>
